!1 IDE Lifecycle Tests

This test verifies the Start and Stop commands for the Delphi IDE.
It is important to run these sequentially as they affect the system state (process).

|set Delphi Version|D11                    |
|check             |Start Ide     |true    |

|script            |TDptIdeLifecycleFixture|
